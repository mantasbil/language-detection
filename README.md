# Language detection project

The aim of this project is to predict in what language the given text is written. For this reason a dataset with text data was chosen from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martinkk5575/language-detection/input?fbclid=IwY2xjawGpzplleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHVMGzCcvVVvOC15te-Xpy57EbrIjXjE2qR0IjOcuz1vnnfOkQBCzaHAyIw_aem_JEXACTp_kfxcu-SR83l6qQ).
Only a sample of this dataset were the given text was written in English, Estonian, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish languages was chosen.

Two packages consisting pretrained language detection models were compared - Langdetect and LangID.

Both methods achieved extremely high accuracy of 97%. It can be noted that no mistakes were made when classifying English text.
